# Future Steps

In this markdown we will highlight some future steps to increase the pipeline robustness:

1. Solve the versioning issue, being able to write files in the Yellow Taxi Trip and FHV Trip dataset
2. Import all the datasets as BigQuery tables
3. Solve the versioning issues regarding Delta Lake, being able to write in the Delta Table format
4. Fully connect the generated files with Google Cloud SQL to have row-oriented datasets
5. Write dataflow jobs to automatically load and transform data
